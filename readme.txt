CO7 Jungle Ops
by Valax

Hi everyone,

This is the first 'proper' mission I've made in a long, long time after not playing Arma 3 for an equally long duration. This is just the first pass and I plan on adding more mission variety and features in the future, so I'd be keen to hear people's ideas on that. If anyone knows how to enable the extra voice lines (that you can hear in the official missions) then I'd love to hear how as well! Info below.

Mission:
Locate a hidden VC base in the jungle of Vietnam and destroy any munitions dumps you find. Playable with up to 7 players or AI (or both) on either a hosted listen server or a dedicated server.

Features:
- Playable with AI, players, or a mix of both.
- Randomised (but handpicked) locations to enhance replayability.
- Advanced AI patrol script. AI will communicate and employ advanced tactics to fight the player's group.
- Various parameters, controlling enemy presence, respawn, etc.
- Toggleable CDLC advanced revive system in the parameters to ensure compatibility with ACE Medical if in use (enabled by default, so if using ACE please disable).
- Combat support available for players with radio backpacks via the CDLC support menu (action menu).

Known issues:
- AI team mates must board the transport helis before players, as the helis will fly away as soon as all players are on board.

Any feedback or comments please let me know so I can keep improving. I haven't had the opportunity to test much with multiple players so there could very well be issues!
